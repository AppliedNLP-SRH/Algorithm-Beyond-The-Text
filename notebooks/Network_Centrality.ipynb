    "**Objective:** To visualize the social structure of *Anna Karenina* and quantify character interactions using Network Theory metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Framework:**\n",
    "Tolstoy's novel is structured around two parallel plots that rarely intersect:\n",
    "1.  **The Society Plot (Anna):** A dense, interconnected web of St. Petersburg/Moscow society.\n",
    "2.  **The Rural Plot (Levin):** An isolated, philosophical narrative largely removed from the main social centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "* **Nodes:** Characters (sized by **Degree Centrality**).\n",
    "* **Edges:** Co-occurrence in the same sentence (weighted by frequency).\n",
    "* **Visualization:** A Force-Directed Graph to cluster social groups naturally."

    "\n",
    "1.  **The Hub (Anna):** Anna appears as the largest node with the highest centrality score. She serves as the structural center of the graph, bridging her husband (Karenin), her lover (Vronsky), and the socialite circle (Betsy).\n",
    "2.  **The Isolate (Levin):** Levin is visually marginalized, often appearing on the periphery of the graph. The force-directed layout pushes him away from the center because he lacks direct connections to the antagonist figures (Karenin/Vronsky). His only strong tethers are family (Kitty, Dolly, Stiva).\n",
    "3.  **The Bridge (Stiva):** Stiva Oblonsky acts as the crucial connector. Without his node, the graph would fracture into two disconnected components, mirroring his role in the narrative as the only character welcome in all social circles.\n",
